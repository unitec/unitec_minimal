****************************************

Unitec Minimal is a fluid-width, three-
column theme for Moodle 2.2.

NB: While the theme is for Moodle 2.2,
the version.php file contains the
information for lowering this requirement.
Theme has not been tested in 2.0 or 2.1,
so doing so is currently at your own risk.
My aim is to have this theme fully
compatible with all versions of Moodle 2.
